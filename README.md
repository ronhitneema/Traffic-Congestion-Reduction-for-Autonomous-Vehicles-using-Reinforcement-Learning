# Traffic-Congestion-Reduction-For-Autonomous-Vehicles-Using-Reinforcement-Learning

The Aim of this project is to design an algorithm that will significantly decrease the trip times of vehicles as well as average car density on the map. Simulations will be used to simulate the Environment. SUMO environment will be utilized to design the road network, apply traffic policies and integrate intelligent algorithms with it. SUMO is a free and open traffic simulation suite that allows modeling of intermodal traffic systems including road vehicles, public transport and pedestrians.


## About
PyTorch implementation of "Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)." Based on the information provided, it appears that the directory contains various Python files related to the implementation of TRPO.

The main components of this directory are:

## Directories:

__pycache__: A directory that holds cached Python bytecode files. These files are generated to speed up module importing but can be safely ignored if you want to share or distribute the code.
intersection: Another directory, likely containing related code or additional modules.
Files:

LICENSE.md: A file that may contain the licensing information for this implementation.
Model.py, SimRunner.py, TrafficGenerator.py, conjugate_gradients.py, models.py, replay_memory.py, running_state.py, trpo.py, utils.py: These files seem to be part of the TRPO implementation, possibly containing classes, functions, or utility code used in the main implementation.
README.md: A file containing a description of the implementation, how to use it, and recommended hyperparameters. It also mentions that it is a PyTorch implementation of TRPO and might have references to a newer variant called PPO.
